## 👩‍💻 About Me
I'm Zoar Or Sharvit, exploring how data science tools can be applied through hands-on projects.
Coming from a background in social policy and applied research, I'm passionate about turning ideas into practical, meaningful tools.
To me, programming is not just a technical skill — it's a way to inform, empower, and create impact.


## 📱 About the App

Weather-checker is a simple and intuitive app built with Streamlit.
It allows users to search for any city and instantly get real-time weather information – including temperature, description, and local time – pulled directly from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Skills Demonstrated

- **Python 3.13**
- **Streamlit** – for building the interactive UI
- **Requests** – for handling external API calls
- **Poetry** – for dependency and project management
- **JSON** – for saving and loading configuration
- **Version control** - Git & GitHub

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to run the app on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**  
   Open your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-checker.git
    cd weather-checker
2. **Install dependencies with Poetry**
    Make sure Poetry is installed, then run:
    poetry install
3. **Add your OpenWeatherMap API key**
    Create a file named .streamlit/secrets.toml in the root directory and paste your API key inside:
    api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
4. **Run the app**
    Use the following command to start the app:
    poetry run streamlit run app/app.py
5. **Open the app in your browser**
    Streamlit will provide a local URL (usually http://localhost:8501) – just click it or paste it into your browser.

```

## Final Notes
This project was created as part of a hands-on data science course.

It demonstrates my ability to:
- Build full-stack apps with external API integration
- Use modern tools like Streamlit, Poetry, and Git
- Work independently while maintaining clean, scalable code
