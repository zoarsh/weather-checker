## 👩‍💻 About Me
I'm Zoar Or Sharvit, exploring how data science tools can be applied through hands-on projects.
Coming from a background in social policy and applied research, I'm passionate about turning ideas into practical, meaningful tools.
To me, programming is not just a technical skill — it's a way to inform, empower, and create impact.


## 📱 About the App

Weather-checker is a simple and intuitive app built with Streamlit.
It allows users to search for any city and instantly get real-time weather information – including temperature, description, and local time – pulled directly from the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Final Notes
This project was created as part of a hands-on data science course.

It reflects my ability to:
- Build full-stack apps with external API integration
- Use modern tools like Streamlit, Poetry, and Git
- Work independently while maintaining clean, scalable code
